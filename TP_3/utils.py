    Creates a wrapper that supports saving and loading environemnt states.
    Required for planning algorithms.

    This class will have access to the core environment as self.env, e.g.:
    - self.env.reset()           #reset original env
    - self.env.ale.cloneState()  #make snapshot for atari. load with .restoreState()
    - ...

    You can also use reset() and step() directly for convenience.
    - s, _ = self.reset()                   # same as self.env.reset()
    - s, r, terminated, truncated, _ = self.step(action)  # same as self.env.step(action)
    
    Note that while you may use self.render(), it will spawn a window that cannot be pickled.
    Thus, you will need to call self.close() before pickling will work again.
